📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build an SMS spam classifier using traditional NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms. The model learns to distinguish spam messages from legitimate ones using a labeled dataset of SMS messages.

📂 Dataset
Source: UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset

Format: CSV file with two columns:

label: spam or ham

message: text content of the SMS

⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools
Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn

Modeling: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.

Notebook: Jupyter Notebook (sms_spam_detection.ipynb)

🧠 Approach
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, stemming

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Spam vs Ham distribution

Common word frequencies

Text Vectorization

Using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer

Model Building

Tested multiple models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM

Model Evaluation

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
