## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build an SMS spam classifier using traditional NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms. The model learns to distinguish spam messages from legitimate ones using a labeled dataset of SMS messages.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)
- **Format**: CSV file with two columns:
  - `label`: spam or ham
  - `message`: text content of the SMS

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- **Modeling**: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.  
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook (`sms_spam_detection.ipynb`)

## 🧠 Approach

### 🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Lowercasing  
- Punctuation removal  
- Stopword filtering  
- Stemming  

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Spam vs Ham distribution  
- Common word frequencies  

### 🔹 Text Vectorization
- Using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer  

### 🔹 Model Building
- Tested models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM  

### 🔹 Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix
